# Live video and chatting application
-- This is a simple React application to demostrate live video calling and live messaging with the help of WebRTC protocol and associated APIs.

# Why use WebRTC?
-- Although there are ways to do live video streaming e.g. we can use WebSockets to transfer the MediaStream from one peer to another peer, but it comes with a disadvantage which is higher latency and dependency on the server for transferring the MediaStream. But in the case of WebRTC there is no need for a server to transmit the MediaStream from one peer to another instead the MediaStream will be transmitted directly without middle men.
